Diabetes Prediction Project
Overview
This project aims to predict whether an individual is likely to have diabetes based on health parameters. The dataset is analyzed, and a machine learning model is trained to perform the predictions.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains features such as:

Pregnancies
Glucose level
Blood Pressure
Skin Thickness
Insulin
BMI (Body Mass Index)
Diabetes Pedigree Function
Age
The target variable is a binary value representing whether the individual has diabetes or not (1 for Yes, 0 for No).

Project Steps
Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, normalized features, and performed train-test split.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed data using visualizations to identify trends and correlations.
Model Building: Built and trained different models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
